# Network-GUI-Bluejay
This is the project based off of Chapter 10 of the BlueJ book(https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/). The goal of the project is to make an inheritance based "Social Network" in which you are able to create posts of different varieties like an _event_ post, a _picture_ post as well as a _message_ post. 

Additional features include a _like_ button that allows for likes to show up on posts as well as a _comment_ button that allows for comments to show up under a post.

# Enhancement

Past the project described, I hope to make this more than a simulation that simply recreates a social network but actually allows people on different devices to communicate through this shared application.

This is more difficult than it seems as this is not applicable through a Graphical User Interface that holds limited capability. Instead a application must be made through either a website (requires HTML) or via Windows application??.

Past this initial challenge if a direct connection is hoped to be made the computers will need to link via network to be able to send packages (for the images posted) to allow for them to be displayed direcctly. Another way of accomplishing this is through directly displaying (printing the image) can be done via an Image Reader: https://github.com/lab596/ImageReader
