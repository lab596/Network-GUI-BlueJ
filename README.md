# Network-GUI-Bluejay
This is the project based off of Chapter 10 of the BlueJ book(https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/). Goal of the project is to make an inheritance based "Social Network" in which you are able to create posts of different varieties like _event_ post, _picture_ post as well as the _message_ post. 

Recent features include a _like_ button that allows for likes to show up on posts as well as a _comment_ button that allows for comments to show up under a post.
